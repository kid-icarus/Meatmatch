# MeatMatch

Match a [chat.meatspac.es](https://chat.meatspac.es) gif with its message. Then
match another. Keep going. Forever.

## Repo Setup

Copy `config.sample.json` to `config.json`. Maybe change the session secret.
Also change the socket url to point to production if you're into that. If
deploying to an environment like Heroku config settings can be set through
environment variables.
